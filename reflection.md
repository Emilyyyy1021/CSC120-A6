- What are your initial impressions of how `Inheritance` affects your programming?
I would be able to do less work. Although this homework doesn't have much inheritance with the functions, but I can see how the classes influence with each other. 

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
I was able to grasp how hastable works very quickly, which surprised me a lot. I still do not understand how inheritance works with the functions. Learn the concepts better, because at this stage coding seems fine.
